# the launch populates a pyon.yml template file and injects it into the
# launched containers in the system. If you set this value to a local
# path, the launch will also write the pyon config there. This is useful
# for running tests or preload steps against a launched environment.
# For example you might write directly to pyon.local.yml in a coi-services
# source tree:

#     pyon_config_output: ~/code/coi-services/res/config/pyon.local.yml
